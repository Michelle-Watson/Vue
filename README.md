Follow along installation

## Can create a project through... 
### Command line (easier)
```
vue create test
(default)
npm run serve
```

### Vue UI (analytics)
```
vue ui
```
Create > Create new project
Tasks > serve > Run task (same as npm run serve)


## Thought Process
I've added commets throughout the files to help me understand what each line is doing, I hope it helps you too.
